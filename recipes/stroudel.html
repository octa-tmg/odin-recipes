        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Apples: The tartness from Granny Smith apples perfectly balances the sweet brown sugar. </li>
            <li>Brown sugar: Opt for light brown sugar for the perfect sweet, cozy flavor. </li>
            <li>Golden raisins: Golden raisins take the flavor and texture up a few notches. </li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the apple strudel filling. </li>
            <li>Puff pastry: Two thawed puff pastry sheets are key to making this easy apple strudel. </li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it wonâ€™t make the strudel taste salty. </li>
            <li>Egg and milk: Brushing an egg wash (made with one egg and a tablespoon of whole milk) over the puff pastry before baking ensures a gorgeous golden brown finish. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Recipe</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place shredded and chopped apples in a large bowl. Stir in brown sugar, golden raisins, flour, and salt; set aside.</li>
            <li>Working with one sheet at a time, place puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll lightly with a rolling pin into an approximately 10- x 12-inch rectangle. Arrange 1/2 of the apple filling (about 3 cups) down one side of pastry lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Fold pastry lengthwise over apple mixture; dampen edges of pastry with water, then press or crimp edges to seal. Repeat process with 2nd pastry sheet and remaining apple mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer to prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 2-inches between each pastry. Whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl; brush on top of each pastry. Cut 3 or 4 slits on top of each pastry to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
